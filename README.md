## FALLING BLOCKS THAT DISAPPEAR WHEN THEY FORM A LINE

Falling Blocks is a puzzle game that can be played in either single player mode or multi-player mode.
The app is similar to the classic game Tetris, with the exception that it can be played head to head over a network.

### The Rules
In  multiplayer mode, players compete against each other to see who can score more points. In this mode, a player is granted powers when four lines are cleared. These powers can be used to disrupt the opponent's game.
The powers are as followed:<br/>

    *HIDE OPPONENTS CONTROLS: When activated, the opponents d-pad disappears.
    *CLEAR OPPONENTS PROGRESS: When activated, any progress the opponents makes disappear. 
    *BLOCK OPPPONENTS VIEW: When activated, the screen is obscured
    *FOR USE OF ACCELEROMETER: When activated, the controls will no longer work, and the opponent will be forced to use the device's  accelerometer
