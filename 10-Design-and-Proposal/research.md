============WORKSHEETS BELOW===================

What are people trying to do? What are their goals?
Out of the limited number surveyed, it appears that people play games to occupy their time, especially when they are not in a position to do something else. For example, most of the participants said they play casual games on the train or subway ride home.
Games (like “Words with friends”) also connects them with their friends when they play mutliplayer/turn based.

What do you think is motivating them?
Entertainment value, where there is much other entertainment value available. Also, some games were described as “addictive.”




===Persona WorkSheet——

23 year old female who plays Candy Crush and Word with Friends on the train ride into the city.
She is currently at her first job, and when she doesn’t or can’t do work on the train, she plays candy crush. Occasionally, she plays “Words with Friends” and finds it a good way to keep in touch with her friends from college. She never had a video game console, although her brother did. She doesn’t consider herself a gamer, or even the fact that she plays a game. Candy Crush and Words with friends are considered good apps by her, and not a game.

George is 43 and rides the Metro North everyday into work in the city.
George  grew up with the original nintendo entertainment system, and had all different types of systems growing up. Once George got married, he doesn't play as much as he would like. He did splurge one time and buy a xbox 360, but haven;t found the opportunity to play. He was happy once iPads came out, on the train ride home and it reminds him of playing games on the PC growing up. Currently, he is playing Myst. He does not play multi player games, but also enjoys the casual game when he gets frustrated with his other games.


==PERSONA (made from interviews)
The main target of this app is Lisa, the persona who doesn’t consider herself a gamer. The games she plays are typically simple,with one or two basic rules. Her games do not require time commitment or much setup. The games are a distraction on the train ride from an otherwise busy day, although she enjoys beating her own high score/getting to the next level, or beating her friend with a good word (when playing words with friends).


==PROBLEM STATEMENT
Lisa needs a way to entertain herself before or after a long day of work, because she needs a distraction that doesn’t require time commitment.
